# Discord-MAL
One bot to help users see their MAL & Anilist profile, list, etc on Discord. 

The idea for this bot was given by my friend [@baku](https://github.com/maiorikizu). And brought to life by [@Pilot_kun](https://github.com/Hackers244)

## List of features that are already done and the ones coming soon 
**AniList User Command:** Fetches and displays the AniList user profile based on the provided username. ✅

**Anime/Manga Search:** Users can search for anime/manga titles and receive detailed information, including descriptions, images, genres, and more. ✅

**Watching List:** Users can add or remove anime from their watchlist. ✅

**Episode Notifications:** Get notified when new episodes of anime in your watchlist are released, ensuring you never miss an episode.

**Account Linking:** Link your Discord account with your Anilist account. ✅

**Favorite Anime:** Added a button to fetch and display the user's favorite anime from their AniList profile. ✅

**Profile Command:** Displays the user's AniList profile with detailed statistics and favorite anime. ✅

**Register Commands:** Registers all the application (/) commands to the Discord server. ✅

## Future Enhancements
