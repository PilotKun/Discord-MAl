# Step-by-Step Roadmap for Discord Bot

## Overview
This Discord bot will use `discord.js` and the AniList API to provide anime-related functionalities to users. The primary features include retrieving user profile data from AniList, searching for anime in the AniList database, and managing a personalized watchlist. Notifications for new episodes of watchlisted anime will also be included as a low-priority feature.

## Step-by-Step Development Plan

### Step 1: Project Initialization (Week 1) ✅
1. Install Node.js and initialize the project using `npm init`.
2. Set up a Git repository for version control.
3. Install required dependencies:
   - `discord.js` for interacting with Discord.
   - `dotenv` for managing environment variables.
   - `axios` for API requests.
   - `mongoose` for MongoDB integration (if using MongoDB).
4. Create the bot's basic folder structure:
   - `/src`
     - `commands/`
     - `events/`
     - `utils/`
   - `.env` for API keys and tokens.
5. Register the bot with Discord and get the bot token.
6. Test a simple bot connection to Discord.

### Step 2: User Profile Retrieval (Week 2) ✅
1. Set up the AniList API:
   - Obtain an API key from AniList.
   - Test API requests using Postman or a similar tool.
2. Create a command to fetch and display AniList user profile data:
   - Use the `/profile` command.
   - Parse and format profile details like username, stats, and favorites.
3. Implement error handling for API request failures or invalid usernames.

### Step 3: Anime Search (Week 3)
1. Design a `/search` command:
   - Accept search keywords or filters as arguments.
   - Query the AniList API for anime matching the criteria.
2. Format search results for clarity:
   - Display title, synopsis, and rating.
   - Limit the number of results for readability.
3. Handle edge cases (e.g., no results found).

### Step 4: Watchlist Management (Week 4-5)
1. Set up a MongoDB database:
   - Create a `User` schema to store watchlists.
   - Connect the database to the project using `mongoose`.
2. Implement `/add` and `/remove` commands for the watchlist:
   - `/add <anime_id>`: Add an anime to the user's watchlist.
   - `/remove <anime_id>`: Remove an anime from the watchlist.
3. Create a `/watchlist` command to display the user's stored anime.
4. Ensure database operations are efficient and secure.

### Step 5: Notification System (Week 6-7)
1. Implement a scheduler using `node-cron`:
   - Periodically check the AniList API for new episodes of watchlisted anime.
   - Compare the latest episode count with the stored data.
2. Build a notification delivery system:
   - Send alerts to users via Discord DMs or a designated channel.
   - Allow users to customize notification settings.
3. Optimize the system to avoid excessive API calls.

### Step 6: Testing and Optimization (Week 8)
1. Test each command and feature extensively:
   - Verify proper functioning under various scenarios.
   - Check for API rate limits and handle errors gracefully.
2. Optimize code for performance:
   - Refactor repetitive logic.
   - Ensure database queries are efficient.
3. Prepare for deployment:
   - Test the bot on a staging server.
   - Set up hosting on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Railway.

### Step 7: Deployment and Maintenance
1. Deploy the bot to a hosting platform.
2. Monitor logs for errors and performance issues.
3. Collect user feedback for future improvements.
4. Plan regular updates to enhance features and fix bugs.
